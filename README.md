# Ad_Blocker
Ad_Blocker tool 
To run the browser ad blocker code, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste the provided Python code into the file.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `ad_blocker.py`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `ad_blocker.py` file.
6. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python ad_blocker.py
   ```

   Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the `python` command is accessible from the terminal or command prompt.

7. The script will execute and perform the ad blocking operations based on the operating system you are using (Windows, Mac, or Linux). You will see the output messages indicating the status of ad blocking (enabled or disabled).

Remember to adjust the `get_ad_domains()` function in the code to include the specific ad domains you want to block. Additionally, depending on the operating system and file permissions, you might need administrative privileges or root access to modify the hosts file.

Please exercise caution and ensure that you understand the implications before running any code that modifies system files.
